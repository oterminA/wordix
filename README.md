# wordix

This is a repository for a game called Wordix. It was created as a final project for a subject during the first semester of my degree. It is NOT entirely my own work, as it was developed together with a classmate. 
The repository contains two files, but only the one named "programa.php" was fully created by us. We had to design functions that complemented those already implemented in the game. The project made us use repetitive structures, conditional structures, and data structures (such as associative, indexed, and multidimensional arrays).
